Psychic Game is an application that uses vanilla JavaScript to generate a letter for the player to guess. The player has 9 guesses to select the correct letter.

### How It Works
* The user/player has 9 guesses to guess which randomly chosen letter is the correct one.
* Click a letter, and each guess will be shown under "Your guesses so far: ." Once the correct letter has been guessed, the wins field will be updated. If the player loses, a loss will be added to the losses field and the game will begin again.

### Technologies Used
